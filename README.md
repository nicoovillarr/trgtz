I set out to create a mobile app from scratch, and guess what… now you can set goals for yourself too! 📱🚀

*Trgtz* is an app where you can add your goals for the year, share them with friends, and celebrate every achievement together. The idea came to me while reflecting on how to make goal management more interactive and social, allowing people to motivate each other. 🎯🤝

I wanted a tool that not only helped me define my objectives but also allowed me to track my friends’ progress and celebrate our achievements together. Whether you’re aiming for personal growth, career milestones, or fitness improvements, Trgtz is designed to support you every step of the way. 🌱💼💪

Some of the benefits of using Trgtz include:

- *Define clear goals*: Dream big and plan strategically. ✨📊
- *Stay on track*: Monitor your progress and adjust your approach to stay on the path to success. 🛤️🚶‍♂️
- *Receive updates*: Get reminders and notifications to keep you motivated. 🔔🎯

I went through all the usual creation phases: planning, design, development, testing, and launch, using various technologies like Flutter for cross-platform development, Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data management. 💻🛠️

In addition, I managed several crucial processes such as:

1. *Implementing CI/CD* to ensure a seamless, uninterrupted development flow. ⚙️🔄
2. *Purchasing the trgtz.com domain* to establish a professional online presence. 🌐🏠
3. Integrating Cloudflare and Vercel* to optimize the app’s performance and security. 🔐⚡
4. *Creating unit tests* to guarantee the stability and functionality of each component. ✅🧪

My goal with this project was to showcase my skills in my portfolio, and I’m incredibly proud of the outcome.

Trgtz is more than just a goal-setting app; it’s a community where every achievement is celebrated, and every effort is recognized. I’m thrilled to see how Trgtz can transform the way people set and reach their goals. 🎉🏅
